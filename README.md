## Industrial Applicability and Public Artifacts

To confirm the industrial applicability of **DBdoctor**, we provide the official certification documents issued by the **China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT)**, which is the most widely recognized and authoritative database product certification organization in China.

The certification documents are provided in the following files:
- [**Original Document - Certification of SQL Quality Management Platform Capability.pdf**](https://github.com/neighthorn/DBdoctor/blob/main/Original%20Document%20-%20Certification%20of%20SQL%20Quality%20Management%20Platform%20Capability.pdf)
- [**Translated Version - Certification of SQL Quality Management Platform Capability.pdf**](https://github.com/neighthorn/DBdoctor/blob/main/Translated%20Version%20-%20Certification%20of%20SQL%20Quality%20Management%20Platform%20Capability.pdf)

## Public Probe Examples

To maximize the utility of this work to the research community, we also publicly release a **representative subset of probes** used in DBdoctor. This includes the monitored database/kernel functions and the corresponding runtime variables collected by each probe.

These examples demonstrate how fine-grained metrics are collected and correlated to each SQL statement in practice and may serve as useful references for researchers and practitioners when building probe sets for their own DBMSs.

The probe examples are provided in:
